# Guess-the-Country-Game-with-Python
A fun game where you try to guess the name of the country by entering one letter at a time.


By importing the random library we pick a random country from a list than getting a letter from a user. The program cheks if the letter exists in the word,
if yes shows the position of the letter in the chart to help the user guess the next letter.

Also if the user enteres the same letter tells the user that given letter has already been entered, try another letter.

Initially user has 7 guesses and guess count decreases eveytime the user cannot guess a letter in the word.
